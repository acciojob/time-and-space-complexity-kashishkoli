<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. It is important to optimize time complexity for efficient algorithms. For example, a linear search algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), meaning it takes n operations to search through a list of n elements.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses to run as a function of its input size. It is important to optimize space complexity for efficient algorithms. For example, a recursive algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number has a space complexity of O(n), meaning it uses n stack frames to calculate the factorial. However, in this case, the <b>Space Complexity</b> is not as important as the time complexity, as the recursive algorithm can be optimized to use only a constant amount of space.</p>
